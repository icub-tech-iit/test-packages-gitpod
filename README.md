Test Packages on Gitpod
=======================

A one-off disposable environment to test packages for the **`latest ubuntu`** release of our SW distros.

To get started, simply click on the badge below:

[![Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)][1]

Find out more on [YARP-enabled Gitpod workspaces][2].

Instead, if you aim to test against different **`distros/releases`**, do:
1. üìù Edit the file [`.gitpod.Dockerfile`](/.gitpod.Dockerfile) and create a **`new branch`**. In detail, you have to fiddle with these [sections][3].
1. üöÄ Launch the corresponding Gitpod workspace from within the new branch. Don't click on the main badge but rather customize the [URL context][4]. To ease this operation, you may install the [Gitpod browser extension][5].
1. üßπ Possibly, finish up by wiping out the branch.

‚ö† As Docker relies on cached sections, you may still be using an old image when you've just updated a package to test. To invalidate the cache forcing Docker to build the relevant sections entirely again, apply this [workaround][6].
